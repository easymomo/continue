# AIgents Documentation

Welcome to the AIgents documentation. This folder contains comprehensive documentation for the AIgents project, including architecture, API references, usage examples, and more.

## Getting Started with Documentation

For a complete navigation of all documentation resources, please see:

**[→ Documentation Navigation](navigation.md)**

This centralized navigation file serves as the main entry point to all project documentation and is kept up-to-date with all available documentation resources.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several main categories:

- Project Overview
- Architecture
- Task Management System
- Project Management
- Technologies
- Implementations
- Usage Guides

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Create your documentation file in the appropriate subfolder
2. Add a link to the navigation file at the top: `_[← Back to Documentation Navigation](navigation.md)_`
3. Update the [navigation.md](navigation.md) file to include your new document

## Building Documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown format for maximum compatibility. In the future, we may implement a documentation site generator to enable additional features like dark mode and interactive diagrams.
