# AIgents Task Management System

A comprehensive TypeScript-based task management system designed for maintaining context across task transitions.

## Overview

The AIgents Task Management System provides a robust framework for managing tasks, their states, relationships, and associated contexts. It's built with a focus on preserving context during task transitions, ensuring proper task boundaries, and maintaining task hierarchies.

## Key Features

- **Task Verification**: Validate task creation, transitions, and boundaries
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain and transfer context between tasks
- **Task Relationships**: Manage parent-child task hierarchies
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Execute custom logic at different stages of task operations
- **Task State Management**: Handle task transitions with proper validation

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of six main components:

1. **Task Verifier**: Ensures tasks meet requirements for creation and transitions
2. **Task Relationship Manager**: Manages parent-child relationships between tasks
3. **Task Context Manager**: Preserves and transfers task context
4. **Task Transition Manager**: Handles task state transitions
5. **Task Lifecycle Manager**: Provides hooks for custom logic execution
6. **Task Manager**: Integrates all components through a unified API

## Recent Implementation: Task Relationship Manager

The Task Relationship Manager has been successfully implemented, providing a comprehensive system for handling parent-child relationships between tasks. This component is essential for maintaining task hierarchies and ensuring proper task boundaries.

### Key Functionality

The Task Relationship Manager implements the following capabilities:

- **Create Child Tasks**: Create subtasks associated with a parent task
- **Retrieve Task Hierarchies**: Get child tasks, parent tasks, and complete task lineage
- **Validate Relationships**: Ensure proper parent-child relationships
- **Manage Task Dependencies**: Update task relationships and handle task status propagation
- **Navigate Task Hierarchies**: Traverse task lineages and find related tasks

### Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

- **Task Relationship Model**: Clear definition of parent-child relationships with metadata
- **Hierarchy Management**: Methods for creating, retrieving, and updating task hierarchies
- **Lineage Tracking**: Functionality to trace the complete ancestry of a task
- **Relationship Validation**: Guards against circular dependencies and invalid relationships
- **Transaction Support**: All operations are wrapped in transactions for data consistency

This implementation works together with the Task Verifier to ensure that task boundaries are properly maintained and validated during transitions.

## Integration with AIgents

The Task Management System is a key component of the AIgents Project, providing the foundation for:

- **Agent Context Management**: Preserving context between agent interactions
- **Task-based Agent Workflows**: Structuring agent activities as tasks and subtasks
- **Validation of Agent Operations**: Ensuring agents perform operations within valid boundaries
- **Agent Task History**: Maintaining a record of agent activities and task hierarchies

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { TaskManager } from "aigents/task-management";

// Initialize the task manager
const taskManager = new TaskManager();

// Create a task
const taskId = await taskManager.createTask({
  name: "Implement Feature",
  description: "Complete implementation of the feature",
  priority: "high",
});

// Start the task
await taskManager.startTask(taskId);

// Create a child task
const childTaskId = await taskManager.createChildTask(taskId, {
  name: "Frontend Implementation",
  description: "Implement the UI components",
});

// Complete tasks
await taskManager.completeTask(childTaskId);
await taskManager.completeTask(taskId);
```

### Working with Task Relationships

```typescript
// Create a parent task
const parentTaskId = await taskManager.createTask({
  name: "Project Implementation",
  description: "Complete project implementation",
});

// Create child tasks
const backendTaskId = await taskManager.createChildTask(parentTaskId, {
  name: "Backend Implementation",
  description: "Implement the backend services",
});

const frontendTaskId = await taskManager.createChildTask(parentTaskId, {
  name: "Frontend Implementation",
  description: "Implement the UI components",
});

// Get all child tasks for a parent
const childTasks = await taskManager.getChildTasks(parentTaskId);
console.log(`Parent task has ${childTasks.length} child tasks`);

// Get the parent of a task
const parentTask = await taskManager.getParentTask(backendTaskId);
console.log(`Parent task: ${parentTask.name}`);

// Get the task lineage (all ancestors)
const taskLineage = await taskManager.getTaskLineage(frontendTaskId);
console.log(`Task has ${taskLineage.length} ancestors`);

// Check if a task is a descendant of another task
const isDescendant = await taskManager.isDescendantOf(
  frontendTaskId,
  parentTaskId,
);
console.log(`Is task a descendant: ${isDescendant}`);

// Update a task's parent
await taskManager.updateTaskParent(frontendTaskId, backendTaskId);
```

## Core Concepts

### Tasks

Tasks are the fundamental units of work. Each task has properties like:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Task name
- `description`: Task description
- `status`: Current state (planned, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- `priority`: Importance level
- `steps`: Sub-items within a task
- `metadata`: Additional task data
- `parentId`: Optional reference to parent task

### Task Relationships

Tasks can have hierarchical relationships:

- Parent tasks can have multiple child tasks
- Child tasks can reference their parent
- Task lineage can be tracked
- Relationships include metadata like creation time
- Tasks can be related as siblings (sharing the same parent)

### Task Verification

The system verifies operations to ensure data integrity:

- Task creation validation
- Transition validation
- Boundary validation
- Context availability checks
- Relationship validation

### Context

Context represents the environment and state associated with a task, including:

- Task-specific information
- Environmental variables
- Code state
- Resources and references
- Metadata

## Advanced Features

- **Context Diff**: Compare contexts between tasks
- **Batch Operations**: Perform operations on multiple tasks
- **Custom Verification**: Implement domain-specific validation logic
- **Task Recommendations**: Get suggestions for fixing validation issues
- **Task Lineage Traversal**: Navigate complex task hierarchies

## Implementation Progress

The implementation of the AIgents Task Management System is progressing according to the following roadmap:

1. ‚úÖ **Task Verifier** - Completed implementation of task verification logic
2. ‚úÖ **Task Relationship Manager** - Completed implementation of task relationship handling
3. üîÑ **Task Context Manager** - In progress
4. üîÑ **Task Transition Manager** - In progress
5. üîÑ **Task Lifecycle Manager** - In progress
6. üîÑ **Task Manager Integration** - In progress

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Task Management System include:

- **Enhanced Task History**: Detailed tracking of task changes over time
- **Task Templates**: Reusable templates for common task structures
- **Advanced Context Management**: Improved context capture and transfer
- **Performance Optimizations**: For handling large task graphs
- **Advanced Visualization**: Tools for visualizing task hierarchies

## Integration APIs

The system provides APIs for integration with the broader AIgents ecosystem:

- **Agent Integration API**: For connecting agents to the task management system
- **Event Subscription API**: For subscribing to task lifecycle events
- **Context Query API**: For querying task context from external systems
- **Task Import/Export API**: For transferring tasks between systems
