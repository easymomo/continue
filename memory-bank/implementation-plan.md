# AIgents Framework Implementation Plan

- **Last Updated**: 2024-05-13
- **Current Phase**: Memory System Implementation & Worker Agent Integration

## Architecture Overview

The AIgents framework uses a multi-agent approach with a coordinator agent orchestrating specialized worker agents. The implementation follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns through the adapter pattern.

## Core Components

### Adapter Layer

- **Continue API Adapter**: Interface between VS Code extension and AIgents framework
- **LLM Adapter**: Interface for language model interactions, fully implemented with robust type safety
- **Memory Adapter**: Interface for state persistence (implementation in progress)

### Agent System

- **Coordinator Agent**: Central orchestrator that routes requests to specialized worker agents
- **Worker Agents**: Specialized agents for specific tasks
  - **Research Agent**: Information gathering and analysis
  - **Developer Agent**: Code implementation and technical solutions
  - **Security Agent**: Security analysis and recommendations
  - **Documentation Agent**: (Planned) Documentation generation
  - **Testing Agent**: (Planned) Test creation and verification
  - **Evaluation Agent**: (Planned) Code review and assessment

### Worker Agent Design

Worker agents follow a consistent object-oriented design pattern:

- Each extends the `BaseAgent` abstract class
- Each implements the `Agent` interface
- Each has a specialized system prompt defining its role
- Each implements the `process()` method for message handling
- Each includes logic for when to return control to the coordinator

### Memory & Context System

The memory system uses a composition-based approach:

- `AgentMemory` class provides typed memory access for agents
- `MemoryManager` handles persistence and retrieval
- Memory items can be stored, queried, and managed across sessions
- Context management enables hierarchical organization of agent knowledge

- Design UI interactions
- Create sidebar and panel components
- Handle file context and workspace navigation

## Current Progress

- Core agent structure has been implemented
- Worker agents (Research, Developer, Security) have been implemented
- Each agent has specialized system prompts and responsibilities
- Basic agent orchestration mechanism is in place
- Fixed type issues in the LLM adapter layer, improving code robustness

- Completed VS Code extension command registration for agent interactions

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Memory System Integration**:

   - Integrate the memory system with all worker agents
   - Implement context persistence across agent interactions
   - Finalize memory querying and retrieval mechanisms
   - Test memory state preservation across sessions

2. **Enhance Worker Agent Capabilities**:

   - Refine agent specializations and system prompts
   - Implement worker agent state persistence
   - Create robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Add agent capability awareness

3. **Complete Tool Integration**:

   - Define tool interface classes
   - Implement file analysis tools
   - Create code generation utilities
   - Add web search capabilities
   - Implement security scanning tools

4. **Finalize VS Code Extension Integration**:
   - Implement settings management
   - Create UI components
   - Handle workspace context

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript for all implementations
- LangChain.js for agent orchestration
- Node.js compatibility
- VS Code extension API compatibility
- Unit tests for all critical components
