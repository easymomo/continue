# Agent Architecture Implementation

## Overview

The project implements a team-based multi-agent architecture with a coordinator agent that manages specialized worker agents. The architecture is designed to handle different aspects of software development through specialized agents while maintaining a cohesive workflow through a central coordination mechanism.

## Class Hierarchy

- **BaseAgent** (abstract class): Provides core functionality for all agents
- **CoordinatorAgent**: Manages and routes tasks to specialized agents
- Specialized Worker Agents:
  - **DeveloperAgent**: Implements coding tasks and technical solutions
  - **ResearchAgent**: Gathers information and performs analysis
  - **SecurityAgent**: Assesses security implications and best practices

## Agent Creation Flow

The `AgentFactory` class is responsible for creating and initializing all agents:

1. The `initializeAgentSystem()` method creates an `AgentSystem` instance
2. `createAllAgents()` creates all agent instances with the same LLM model
3. Worker agents are registered with the coordinator
4. All agents are returned to be registered with the agent system

## Communication Protocol

Agents communicate through a message-based system:

1. The `shouldReturnToCoordinator()` method in each worker agent determines when to hand back control
2. Agents can detect specific phrases in responses that suggest another agent should be involved
3. When handoff is needed, a `Command` object is returned with `goto: "coordinator"` to return control
4. The coordinator can then route the task to another appropriate agent

## Agent Capabilities

### CoordinatorAgent

- Analyzes user requests to determine which specialized agent should handle them
- Delegates tasks to appropriate worker agents
- Maintains conversation context across agent handoffs
- Provides final responses to the user

### DeveloperAgent

- Implements features and functionality
- Writes clean, efficient code
- Assists with debugging and technical issues
- Follows best practices and coding standards

### ResearchAgent

- Searches for relevant information
- Analyzes documentation, APIs, libraries
- Evaluates technology options
- Summarizes complex technical information

### SecurityAgent

- Identifies security vulnerabilities
- Recommends secure coding patterns
- Assesses code for common security issues
- Suggests security testing approaches

## Integration with LangChain

The architecture leverages LangChain components:

- **LangGraph**: Used for managing agent workflows and transitions between agents
- **BaseChatModel**: Interface for LLM interactions
- **Command**: Used for workflow control to direct execution flow between agents

## Memory System Integration

The agents can access a shared memory system that allows for:

- Storing and retrieving information as the agents work
- Maintaining context between different agent interactions
- Creating persistent memory for long-term knowledge

## Implementation Notes

1. Each agent has a specific system prompt that defines its role and responsibilities
2. Coordinator agent contains methods to determine which worker agent should handle a request
3. Worker agents contain logic to determine when to return control to the coordinator
4. The `AgentFactory` ensures all agents share the same underlying language model
5. Tools specific to each agent type can be created through the `createAgentTools()` method

## Current Status

The agent architecture is implemented with basic functionality, but several areas need further development:

1. The specialized tool sets for each agent type
2. More sophisticated routing logic in the coordinator
3. Enhanced memory persistence and context management
4. Testing framework for agent interactions
5. Metrics and monitoring for agent performance
