# Active Context

## Current Work Session

**Last Updated:** 2024-05-20  
**Current Focus:** Testing framework for agent workflows and memory integration

## Project State

### Current Phase

- Testing security workflow implementation
- Integrating memory system with agents
- Implementing workflow stages for specialized agents
- Enhancing testing capabilities with reusable components

### Recent Activity

- Created comprehensive workflow testing framework:
  - Implemented BaseMockTaskAdapter template for reusable test components
  - Developed detailed workflow testing guidelines
  - Created example security workflow test implementation
  - Added documentation for common testing patterns and pitfalls
- Successfully tested the complete security workflow lifecycle including:
  - Task creation in ASSESSMENT stage
  - Adding security requirements and artifacts
  - Transitioning through workflow stages (ASSESSMENT → ANALYSIS → REMEDIATION → COMPLETED)
  - Tracking vulnerabilities, affected files and components
  - Stage transition validation with configurable rules
- Fixed issues with TypeScript enum compatibility by using object literals instead
- Updated documentation with agent architecture details and testing best practices
- Added comprehensive agent-task system architecture documentation
- Tracked progress in tasks.md and progress.md

### Next Priorities

- Complete integration of security workflow with agent coordination
- Fix linter errors in DeveloperTaskManager and related files
- Address TypeScript configuration issues with memory imports
- Implement comprehensive Vitest testing for task transitions
- Create end-to-end test for agent coordination with security findings

## Technical Notes

### LLM Adapter Layer

- The LLM adapter layer is now robust with addressed type issues
- ContinueLLMAdapter correctly handles model selection and defaults
- The LLM factory pattern allows for extension with different providers

### Agent Framework

- BaseAgent provides core functionality for all agents
- TaskSystemAdapter provides memory capabilities to agents without modifying BaseAgent
- Memory integration allows agents to persist state and context
- Agent implementations follow consistent patterns:
  - ResearchAgent - handles research tasks with progressive workflow stages
  - DeveloperAgent - manages code implementation with development workflow
  - SecurityAgent - performs security analysis with security audit workflow stages

### Testing Framework

- Created a comprehensive workflow testing framework:
  - BaseMockTaskAdapter - reusable generic class for workflow testing
  - Workflow testing guidelines - detailed documentation on testing approaches
  - Example implementation - security workflow test example
  - Common patterns - documented solutions for TypeScript enum issues and validation approaches
- Key testing capabilities:
  - In-memory task storage for fast test execution
  - Transition logging for debugging and verification
  - Comprehensive validation of workflow rules
  - Support for full workflow lifecycle testing
  - Structured approaches for handling TypeScript type safety

### Security Agent Workflow

- Implemented and tested a structured workflow with defined stages:
  - ASSESSMENT: Initial security requirement gathering
  - ANALYSIS: Detailed security analysis of code/systems
  - VULNERABILITY_SCAN: Active scanning for security issues
  - REMEDIATION: Recommending fixes for identified issues
  - VERIFICATION: Verifying implemented security fixes
  - COMPLETED: Security assessment completion
- Created security-specific artifact types:
  - SCAN_REPORT: Results from automated security scans
  - VULNERABILITY_REPORT: Detailed vulnerability assessments
  - REMEDIATION_PLAN: Plan for addressing security issues
  - VERIFICATION_REPORT: Results from verification testing
  - SECURITY_ASSESSMENT: Overall security posture assessment
- Successfully tested helper functions for security operations:
  - Severity detection (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Affected files identification
  - Security requirement parsing
  - Workflow stage transitions
  - Vulnerability tracking

### Memory System

- Agents use composition with TaskSystemAdapter rather than inheritance
- Memory operations include:
  - Storing messages, decisions, and documents
  - Creating and managing contexts
  - Task management for different agent types
  - Transaction support for persistence
- Security-specific memory enhancements:
  - Vulnerability storage with severity metadata
  - Affected files and vulnerable components tracking
  - Security requirements management

### Current Issues

- TypeScript configuration needs adjustment for memory imports (file paths not under rootDir)
- Linter errors in DeveloperTaskManager and related files
- Some compatibility issues with TypeScript enums in standalone tests (worked around by using object literals)

## Coordination Architecture

- Coordinator dispatches tasks to specialized agents
- Workflow transitions between agents based on context
- Message routing determines appropriate agent for each request
- SecurityAgent can return to coordinator with specific reasoning about needed development assistance

## Project Information

- **Project Name**: AI Dev Agents
- **Last Updated**: 2024-05-20
- **Current Phase**: Implementation and Testing
- **Focus Area**: Workflow Testing Framework and Task Management Integration
- **Task Complexity**: Level 3 - Feature Implementation

## Current Technical Focus

We've successfully implemented and tested security workflow stages and task management with the following components:

1. **SecurityWorkflowStage**: Defines stages in the security assessment process
2. **SecurityArtifactType**: Types of security findings and artifacts
3. **SecurityTaskManager**: Manages security task lifecycle and transitions
4. **Security helper functions**: Support utilities for security operations
5. **Standalone test framework**: Validates the security workflow implementation

We've also created a comprehensive testing framework:

1. **BaseMockTaskAdapter**: Generic adapter template for workflow testing
2. **Workflow Testing Guide**: Documentation on testing best practices
3. **Security Workflow Test Example**: Complete example of workflow testing
4. **Agent Architecture Documentation**: Details of our layered agent system design

Our testing confirms the security workflow enables:

- Structured security assessment with clear stage progression
- Detailed tracking of security findings with severity classification
- Systematic vulnerability management through defined workflow stages
- Coordinated handoffs to development teams for remediation
- Verification and validation of security fixes
