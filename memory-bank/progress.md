## Code Analysis Findings

- [x] Identified key Redux thunks handling LLM communication:
  - `streamResponseThunk`: Initiates the conversation flow
  - `streamNormalInput`: Sends actual requests to the LLM
  - `callTool`: Executes tool calls from the LLM
- [x] Discovered LLM integration components:
  - `ideMessenger.llmStreamChat`: Primary method for LLM communication
  - `Ollama` class in `core/llm/llms/Ollama.ts`: Handles Ollama-specific integration
  - `LMStudio` class in `core/llm/llms/LMStudio.ts`: Handles LM Studio integration
- [x] Located model selection functionality:
  - `modelSupportsTools` in `core/llm/autodetect.ts`: Checks tool compatibility
  - `selectSelectedChatModel`: Redux selector for the current model
- [x] Mapped the agent mode workflow:
  - User input captured by TipTap Editor
  - Context gathered about the codebase
  - Messages formatted and sent to LLM
  - Tool calls handled through policy-based execution
  - Results returned to the LLM for continued conversation

## Next Steps (Implementation Phase 1)

  - [ ] Implement `AgentAdapter` class to intercept messages before LLM
  - [ ] Connect adapter to Redux thunks via middleware
  - [ ] Preserve existing model selection dropdown functionality
- [ ] Implement basic agent structure:
  - [ ] Create `BaseAgent` with common functionality
  - [ ] Implement `AgentCoordinator` (Master Agent)
  - [ ] Create specialized worker agents
- [ ] Design and implement agent communication protocol:
  - [ ] Define message format between agents
  - [ ] Create shared memory system
  - [ ] Implement tool call routing through specialized agents
- [ ] Testing with existing LLM infrastructure:
  - [ ] Test with LM Studio integration
  - [ ] Test with Ollama integration
  - [ ] Validate that agent system preserves existing functionality

## Integration Strategy

- [x] Identified optimal integration approach:
  - Add a custom "AIgents" mode to the UI alongside existing modes (Agent, Chat, Edit)
  - Preserve all existing functionality by creating a separate mode
  - Intercept message flow when in AIgents mode to route through agent system
  - Maintain compatibility with existing model selection and LLM connections
  - Add agent coordination without disrupting core extension features
- [x] Mapped key injection points:
  - Mode selector UI to add the AIgents option
  - Chat view to customize for multi-agent interaction
  - Message handlers to route through our agent system when in AIgents mode

## UI Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create custom "AIgents" mode:
  - [ ] Add AIgents option to the mode selector dropdown
  - [ ] Implement mode switching logic
  - [ ] Create visual indicators for AIgents mode
  - [ ] Add agent selector for multi-agent interaction
- [ ] Implement message routing:
  - [ ] Intercept messages when in AIgents mode
  - [ ] Route to appropriate agent based on context
  - [ ] Display agent responses in the chat UI
- [ ] Design agent interaction controls:
  - [ ] Create UI for selecting active agent
  - [ ] Add indicators showing which agent is responding
  - [ ] Implement agent-specific context controls

## Implementation Plan

1. Create core agent framework structure:

```
src/
  agents/
    base/           # Base agent implementation
    coordinator/    # Master agent (Coordinator)
    adapter/        # Adapter to existing VS Code extension
    worker/         # Specialized worker agents
      developer/    # Developer Agent
      research/     # Research Agent
      testing/      # Testing Agent
  communication/    # Agent communication protocol
  memory/           # Shared memory system
  mcp/              # MCP integration
  extension/
    ui/
      modes.ts      # Mode selector implementation
      chatView.ts   # Chat view customization
    activation.ts   # Extension activation
    handlers/       # Message handlers for different modes
  utils/            # Utility functions
```

2. Implement key components:

   - `src/extension/ui/modes.ts`: AIgents mode registration and handling
   - `src/extension/ui/chatView.ts`: Custom UI for multi-agent interaction
   - `src/extension/handlers/aigentsMode.ts`: Message handling for AIgents mode
   - `src/agents/coordinator/index.ts`: Master agent implementation
