# Project Tasks

- **Current Mode**: IMPLEMENT
- **Initialization Date**: 2024-04-18
- **Last Updated**: 2024-05-11

## Project Boundaries

### AIgents vs. Continue Framework

All tasks in this document must comply with the strict separation between AIgents and Continue as outlined in the [Project Guidelines](project_guidelines.md). Key principles:

1. **AIgents Implementation**:

   - All our implementation code goes exclusively in the `/src` folder
   - We never modify Continue's core code directly

2. **Integration Points**:

   - We connect to Continue only through well-defined adapter patterns
   - All integration points must be explicitly documented

3. **Implementation Focus**:
   - Focus development within our `/src` directory
   - Use adapter patterns when connecting to Continue
   - Maintain clear boundaries between systems

This separation must be maintained for all tasks. Any implementation that violates these boundaries is considered incorrect and must be refactored.

## Tasks Summary

- **Completed**: 2
- **In Progress**: 4
- **Planned**: 2
- **Total**: 8

## Active Tasks

#### Design Decisions

This task implements a comprehensive agent-task integration architecture as documented in `memory-bank/integrations/agentTaskIntegration.md`. Key design choices include:

1. **Composition over Inheritance**: Using a composition-based approach with TaskSystemAdapter for maximum flexibility
2. **Specialized Task Managers**: Creating agent-specific task managers (ResearchTaskManager, etc.) for domain-specific lifecycle management
3. **Workflow Stages**: Implementing clear workflow stages for each agent type (Research: Planning, Gathering, Analyzing, etc.)
4. **Context Preservation**: Ensuring context and findings are preserved across task transitions
5. **Task Hierarchy**: Supporting parent-child relationships for complex task decomposition

#### Integration Architecture

The agent-task integration uses a three-layer architecture:

1. **TaskSystemAdapter**: Connects agents with the general task system
2. **Specialized TaskManagers**: Domain-specific task management for different agent types
3. **Enhanced Agents**: Worker agents augmented with task awareness and context management

This architecture enables agents to:

- Create and manage hierarchical tasks
- Track progress through well-defined workflow stages
- Store and retrieve domain-specific findings and artifacts
- Adapt behavior based on current workflow stage
- Preserve context across sessions and task transitions

#### Dependencies

- Agent Framework (Task 1)
- Task Management System (Task 6)
- Worker Agent Implementation (Task 3)

### Recent Progress

The agent-task integration architecture has been designed and implemented for all worker agents. The architecture uses a composition-based approach with the TaskSystemAdapter connecting agents to the task management system.

The ResearchAgent implementation has a structured research workflow with well-defined stages (Planning, Gathering, Analyzing, Synthesizing, Reporting, Completed) and adapts its behavior based on the current stage. The implementation stores research findings, transitions between stages based on user prompts, and preserves context across research sessions.

The SecurityAgent has been successfully integrated with the TaskSystemAdapter for memory functionality, including:

- Context creation and management
- Message storing with source attribution
- Security finding detection with severity determination
- Document storage for findings
- Decision tracking for agent coordination

Next steps include:

   - Storage of security artifacts (findings, reports, etc.)
   - Severity tracking and prioritization

3. Add helper functions for security operations:

   - Extract security requirements from messages
   - Determine security finding severity
   - Identify appropriate stage transitions
   - Format security reports and recommendations

4. Update the SecurityAgent to utilize the workflow stages:
   - Modify system prompts based on current stage
   - Store findings with appropriate metadata
   - Track vulnerabilities across workflow stages
   - Adapt behavior based on current security stage

#### Estimated Effort: Medium

#### Implementation Details

The workflow testing framework includes:

1. **BaseMockTaskAdapter**: A generic template class that provides:

   - In-memory task storage for testing
   - Transition logging for verification
   - Validation of workflow stage transitions
   - Helper methods for common testing operations

2. **Testing Documentation**:

   - Workflow testing guide with best practices
   - Common pitfalls and their solutions
   - Patterns for TypeScript enum handling
   - Examples of complete workflow testing

3. **Example Implementations**:
   - Security workflow test that validates the complete lifecycle
   - Test validation of stage transitions and artifacts
   - Error case handling for invalid transitions

#### Next Steps

- Integrate with Vitest for standardized test reporting
- Extend testing patterns to Research and Developer agents
- Create base task test utilities for common testing operations
- Add code coverage reporting for workflow components
- Create visualization tools for workflow test results
