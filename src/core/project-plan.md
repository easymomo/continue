## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                     | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VSCode API limitations                   | High   | Medium     | Research API capabilities early, design adaptable interfaces                    |
| Performance issues with multiple agents  | High   | Medium     | Implement agent lifecycle management, optimize memory usage                     |
| Context window management complexity     | High   | High       | Develop systematic context reconstruction approach, prioritize critical context |
| Integration challenges with extension    | Medium | Medium     | Create loose coupling between agents and extension, develop minimal MVP first   |

## Success Criteria

The AIgents framework will be considered successful when:

1. It maintains context across multiple interactions without "forgetting"
2. All work is properly organized into tasks with clear tracking
3. The multi-agent system effectively distributes responsibilities
4. The VSCode extension integration is seamless and intuitive
5. Memory usage is efficient and scalable
6. The system follows the plan-driven development approach

## KPIs for Measuring Success
