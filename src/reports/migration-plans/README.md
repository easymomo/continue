# Dependency Migration Plans

This directory contains migration plans for major dependency updates within the AIgents project. These plans are automatically generated by the dependency agent when major version changes are detected.

## Migration Plan Format

Each migration plan file (named `migration-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md`) contains:

1. **Major Version Updates** - A list of dependencies that have major version changes
2. **Per-Dependency Information**:
   - Package directory where the dependency is located
   - Dependency type (regular or dev)
   - Changelog references
   - Update commands
   - Testing recommendations
   - Documentation update requirements

## Integration with AIgents System

Migration plans are designed to be:

1. **Task-Driven** - Each plan generates tasks in the AIgents task system
2. **Documentation-Connected** - Plans link with the Documentation Agent to ensure updated docs
3. **Memory-Persistent** - Plans are stored long-term to maintain context about dependency migrations

## Working with Migration Plans

To implement a migration plan:

1. Review the plan to understand the scope of changes
2. For each dependency, read the changelog to understand breaking changes
3. Create a temporary branch for testing the update
4. Run the suggested update commands
5. Execute tests to verify functionality
6. Fix any issues that arise from breaking changes
7. Document any significant changes required
8. Merge the changes when stable

## Automation

Migration plans can be executed automatically by the AIgents system for dependencies that have been verified as safe to update without human intervention.

## Manual Migration Creation

To manually create a migration plan, run:

```bash
npm run update:deps:agent
```

This will check all dependencies and create a migration plan if needed.
