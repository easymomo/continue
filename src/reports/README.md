# Dependency Reports

This directory contains generated reports from the dependency update checker.

## Report Types

### Dependency Update Reports

Files named `dependency-update-YYYY-MM-DD.md` contain information about:

- Outdated dependencies across all package.json files in the project
- Suggested update commands for each package
- Security vulnerabilities found in dependencies and how to fix them

## Integration with AIgents

The dependency checker is integrated with the AIgents multi-agent system:

1. **Documentation Agent**: Works in conjunction with the Documentation Agent to ensure libraries are up-to-date with their documentation stored in the vector DB.

2. **Task-Based Approach**: Dependency checking can be initiated as a task in the AIgents task stack.

3. **Migration Planning**: Reports serve as the foundation for migration plans when updating dependencies.

## Generating Reports

To generate a new dependency report, run:

```bash
npm run update:deps
```

This will scan all package.json files in the project, check for outdated dependencies and security issues, and generate a comprehensive report.

## Automation

This process can be automated to run periodically as part of the AIgents system to ensure dependencies are always current and secure.
