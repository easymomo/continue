# AIgents Specialized Agents

This directory contains the implementation of all specialized agents used in the AIgents system.

## Agent Architecture

The agent system follows a coordinator-worker architecture:

```
                  ┌───────────────┐
                  │   Coordinator │
                  │     Agent     │
                  └───────┬───────┘
                          │
          ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
          │               │               │
┌─────────▼──────┐ ┌──────▼───────┐ ┌─────▼───────────┐
│  Developer     │ │  Security    │ │  Research       │
│    Agent       │ │    Agent     │ │    Agent        │
└────────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

- **Coordinator Agent**: Acts as the central manager for the multi-agent system
- **Worker Agents**: Specialized agents that handle specific types of tasks

## Specialized Agents

### Coordinator Agent

The Coordinator Agent is the central node in the agent system. It analyzes user requests and determines which specialized agent should handle them.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Analyze user requests
- Route tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- Coordinate between agents for complex tasks
- Provide final responses to users

### Developer Agent

The Developer Agent specializes in coding tasks and technical implementation.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Write high-quality, maintainable code
- Implement features and functionality
- Debug and troubleshoot technical issues
- Refactor and optimize code
- Follow best practices and coding standards

### Security Agent

The Security Agent specializes in security reviews, vulnerability assessment, and secure coding practices.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Identify security vulnerabilities in code
- Recommend secure coding patterns
- Assess code for common security issues (injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Suggest security testing approaches
- Provide explanations of security best practices

### Research Agent

The Research Agent specializes in information gathering, analysis, and synthesis.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Search for technical information
- Analyze documentation, APIs, and libraries
- Evaluate technology options
- Summarize complex technical information
- Track information sources and provide references

## How Agents Work Together

1. **Request Intake**: User requests are processed by the Coordinator Agent
2. **Task Routing**: The Coordinator determines which specialized agent is best suited for the task
3. **Task Execution**: The specialized agent processes the task using its domain knowledge
4. **Collaboration**: For complex tasks, agents may request assistance from other agents
5. **Response Delivery**: The final response is delivered back to the user

## Usage Example

Here's how to use the agent system:

```typescript
import { AgentFactory } from "../core/agentFactory.js";

// Initialize the agent system
const agentSystem = await AgentFactory.initializeAgentSystem();

// Process a message
const result = await agentSystem.processMessage(
  "Implement a secure password validation function in TypeScript",
);

console.log(result);
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned specialized agents for future implementation:

1. **Documentation Agent**: Creating technical documentation, guides, and reference materials
2. **Testing Agent**: Creating test plans and writing unit/integration tests
3. **Evaluation Agent**: Evaluating code quality, performance, and adherence to standards

## Adding New Specialized Agents

To add a new specialized agent:

1. Create a new agent class that extends BaseAgent
2. Define its system prompt and specialized behaviors
3. Implement the process() method to handle messages
4. Register the agent in the AgentFactory
5. Update the Coordinator Agent to recognize and route to the new agent
