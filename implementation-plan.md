## Key Architectural Decisions

### Agent Coordination System

We will implement a graph-based workflow engine for agent coordination, which provides:

- Structured framework for complex multi-agent workflows
- Clear visualization of the coordination process
- Support for formal verification of workflow properties
- Integration with LangGraph's existing command structure

### Specialized Tool System

We will implement a Tool Factory with Categories approach, providing:

- Centralized management of all tools
- Better code organization and separation of concerns
- Sharing of tools across agent types
- Easy testing of tools in isolation

### Agent Memory Persistence

We will implement a Vector Database approach for memory persistence, offering:

- Superior relevance for contextual memory retrieval
- Natural language querying capabilities
- Scalability with increasing memory volume
- Optimized storage for semantic retrieval
